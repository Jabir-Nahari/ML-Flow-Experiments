=== PHASE 1 COMPLETION NOTES ===

✓ Researched MLflow components: Tracking, Projects, Models, Model Registry
✓ Evaluated deployment options: REST API, Docker, Cloud, Batch
✓ Compared tracking UI alternatives: MLflow UI vs W&B vs Neptune
✓ Designed artifact storage strategy: Local filesystem (with S3 migration path)
✓ Configured Model Registry: SQLite backend, local artifacts
✓ Prepared Docker environment checklist
✓ Created MLproject file for reproducibility
✓ Created conda.yaml for environment management

NEXT STEPS (Phase 2):
1. Implement Model Registry with actual model registration
2. Create stage transition workflows (Staging → Production)
3. Build Docker container for model serving
4. Log artifacts (confusion matrix, ROC curves, feature importance)
5. Test REST API endpoints for model inference
6. Demonstrate A/B testing capabilities

DELIVERABLES FROM PHASE 1:
- Research documentation
- Configuration strategy
- Directory structure created: mlruns/, deployment/, temp/, model_artifacts/
- Docker preparation checklist
- MLproject file
- conda.yaml file
- phase1_completion_notes.txt
